    <h2>Tricky Topics</h2>

    <p>This section is captures some exceptional cases within the GS1 system and provides
        guidance on how to handle these cases hen encountered in GS1 Digital Licenses. Its
        recommended that users interested in these topics review the

        <h3>GS1 ID Key Tiers</h3>
        <p>Within the GS1 identification system, keys are broken down into four tiers. Full details may be found
        in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-system-architecture-document/current-standard">GS1 System Architecture</a>,
        but some of the text is reproduced here.
        <ul class="orange-bullets">
        <li>Tier 1: The structure, usage, and lifecycle rules of a GS1 tier 1 key are defined, administered,
        and managed entirely by GS1. A tier 1 key always incorporates a GS1 Prefix. A tier 1 key may
        incorporate a GS1 Company Prefix issued to a user company, who then issues the key, or it may
        be issued in its entirety as an individual key. Tier 1 keys are subject to allocation rules defined
        in GS1 standards, and their association with descriptive data elements is governed by validation
        rules also defined in GS1 standards.</li>
        <li>Tier 2: The structure of a GS1 tier 2 key is defined by GS1 as a GS1 tier 1 key, but its usage
        and lifecycle rules are defined, administered, and managed by an external organization. A tier 2
        key exists within the range of a GS1 Prefix or a GS1 Company Prefix, incorporates additional
        characters administered by an external organization, and includes a check digit or a check
        character pair if required by its corresponding tier 1 key format. Tier 2 keys are unique with
        respect to tier 1 keys of the same type and can be used in most or all applications that support
        the corresponding tier 1 key type. Their allocation and lifecycle rules, however, are defined by
        an organization external to GS1. The degree to which the usage and lifecycle rules are
        compatible with those of the corresponding tier 1 keys is specific to each tier 2 key.</li>
        <li>Tier 3: The structure, usage, and its lifecycle rules of a GS1 tier 3 key are defined, administered,
        and managed entirely by an organization external to GS1. This organization enters into an
        agreement with GS1 that enables its keys to be supported in selected GS1 standards (e.g.,
        within an EPC header).</li>
        <li>Tier 4: The structure and, usage, and lifecycle rules of a GS1 tier 4 key are defined,
        administered, and managed entirely by an organization or entity external to GS1. A tier 4 key
        has no explicit support within the GS1 system, but it may have some implicit support. For
        example, the EPCIS standard supports any URI as an object identifier and trading partners
        could, by mutual greement, agree to use URIs for geographic locations as a ReadPointID for certain events.</li>

    <section id="delegated-key-issuance">
        <h3>Delegated GS1 ID Key Issuance</h3>
        <p>Tier 2 GS1 ID Keys are delegate to organizations outside GS1.  For example,
            the International Standard Book Number (ISBN), issued by the International ISBN Agency. GS1
            Prefixes 978 and 979 are delegated to the Agency for ISBN management</p>

            <p>Currently, GS1 has not issued credentials to Tier 2 Key Organizations, so its unlikely
            that these will be encountered.  However the Digital License system has provisions to
            support GS1 Prefix Licenses issued to Tier 2 Key management organizations like ISBN. These
            crednetials will appear as <code>GS1DelegatedPrefixLicenseCredential</code>.  They can be
            treated like <code>GS1PrefixLicenseCredentials</code> with the following additions:

            <ul>
                <li><code>GS1DelegatedPrefixLicenseCredential</code> can only extend <code>GS1IdentificationKeyLicenseCredential</code></li>
                <li>When validating an <code>GS1IdentificationKeyLicenseCredential</code> that extends a <code>GS1DelegatedPrefixLicenseCredential</code>,
                the <code>identificationKeyType</code> field of the <code>GS1IdentificationKeyLicenseCredential</code> must be supported within the
                <code>identificationKeyType</code> field of the <code>GS1DelegatedPrefixLicenseCredential</code></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

    <section id="data-creation-delegation">
        <h3>Delegation over Data Creation</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the licensee of a GS1 ID Key or Prefix wants to delgate authority over data creation to third parties.  Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li>a partner marketing firm publishing product data</li>
                <li>an authorized planagram provider doing product images and measurements</li>
                <li>authorized shippers</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Party Credentials</h3>

        <p>When using GLNs, which can identify entities within an organization, it might be necessary
            to associate a GLN with a cryptographic identifier like a DID.  The party credential serves
            this purpose.  Specifically the licensee of the prefix (or ID Key License) can issue a party
            credential associating a GLN that stems from the license to another DID. This association can
            be traced back through the same license system to assure that this association is
            authorized by the licensee of the GS1 identifier.</p>
